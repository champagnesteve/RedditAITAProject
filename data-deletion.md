# Data Deletion Instructions

To delete your account and associated data for **[Your App Name]**, email **[Your Contact Email]** with the subject **“Delete My Data”**.  
Include your app‑scoped user ID (if available) and the email associated with your account.

We will confirm deletion or provide a timeline within **30 days**. If we must retain some records to comply with law or prevent fraud, we will restrict them to that purpose and delete them when the legal basis ends.
