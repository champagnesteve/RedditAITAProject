# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2025-09-18

[Your App Name] (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use our app and login dialog, how we use it, and your rights.

## 1) Information We Collect
- **Account Information** (from Facebook Login or other providers): name, email, profile picture, and an app‑scoped user ID.
- **App Usage Data:** features used, buttons clicked, and timestamps to improve performance.
- **Technical Data:** device type, OS, browser, IP address, and error logs for security/diagnostics.
- **Optional Content You Provide:** posts, comments, images, or messages you submit in the app.

We do **not** collect sensitive categories (e.g., health, financial, biometric) unless explicitly needed and clearly disclosed.

## 2) Why We Use Your Information
- Provide core features (authentication, profiles, content display).
- Personalize your experience and recommend relevant features.
- Ensure security, prevent abuse, and debug problems.
- Comply with laws and platform requirements.

## 3) Legal Bases (where applicable)
- **Contract:** to deliver the service you requested.
- **Legitimate Interests:** to keep services safe and improve them.
- **Consent:** where we ask for it (you can withdraw at any time).

## 4) Sharing of Information
We do **not** sell or rent your data. We only share:
- **Service Providers:** hosting, analytics, and customer support—under contract and only as needed.
- **Legal/Compliance:** if required by law or to protect our rights, users, or the public.
- **With Your Direction:** when you connect third‑party services or share content.

## 5) Facebook/Meta Data Use
For users who log in with Facebook, we comply with the **Meta Platform Terms** and **Developer Policies**. We only request permissions necessary for the app’s functions and do not use data for any purpose that violates Meta’s policies. We do not transfer Facebook data to data brokers or use it for independent advertising/marketing without consent.

## 6) Data Retention
We keep personal data only as long as needed for the purposes above, then delete or anonymize it. Typical retention windows are: authentication logs up to 12 months; error logs up to 24 months; user‑generated content until you delete it or your account.

## 7) Your Rights
Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, port, or restrict processing of your data.
- **How to exercise your rights:** email **[Your Contact Email]** with the subject “Privacy Request.”
- We may verify your identity before acting on a request.

## 8) Children
Our app is not directed to children under 13 (or the age of digital consent in your country). We do not knowingly collect data from children under that age.

## 9) Security
We use industry‑standard safeguards (encryption in transit, role‑based access, least privilege). No method is 100% secure.

## 10) International Transfers
If data is processed outside your country, we use lawful transfer mechanisms (e.g., SCCs) where required.

## 11) Contact
**[Your Business/Name]**  
**Email:** [Your Contact Email]  
**Address:** [Your Business Address]

## 12) Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. We will post the new version here with a new Effective Date.

### Data Deletion Instructions
